# hpqpswd

Decrypt passwords generated by HPQPswd.exe utility with OpenSSL or encrypt your own.  
Works on environments with Bash available (confirmed to work on Debian 12 Bookworm, and on Windows via MSYS2).  
Some commands are not POSIX-defined, so can't promise non-broken functionality on POSIX-shells.

How to use:  
`./hpqpswd.sh [--encrypt|--decrypt] [filename]`  
All arguments enclosed in [] brackets, are optional.  
If no arguments are given, defaults to decryption, with default filename of "password.bin"  


Maximum password length is 32 characters.  
If the limit is reached, the scriptwill automatically stop accepting input, and move on to creating the file.  

In some cases, the script might warn about NULL-characters in input. This is expected to happen and not a cause for concern.
If it happens, it does not break the scripts functionality in any way and the resulting files are still correct.  
It's apparently not trivial to suppress the warning, so I let it be.
