# hpqpswd

Decrypt passwords generated by HPQPswd.exe utility with OpenSSL or 
encrypt your own.  Works on environments with Bash available (confirmed 
to work on Debian 12 Bookworm, and on Windows via MSYS2).  Some commands 
are not POSIX-defined, so can't promise non-broken functionality on 
POSIX-shells.

How to use:
`./hpqpswd.sh --help`
`./hpqpswd.sh [--encrypt|--decrypt] [filename]`
All arguments enclosed in [] brackets, are optional.

If no arguments are given, defaults to decryption, with default filename 
of "password.bin".
